**Python + Playwright Automation with OOP Concepts**

This repository is a collection of Python automation scripts using Playwright, designed to showcase practical skills in web automation, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and Python development. It demonstrates hands-on experience with real-world automation tasks through clean, maintainable code and structured examples.

**What’s Included**

**Playwright Automation Examples**

Automates common web tasks such as Amazon login, home screen interactions, and search result handling. Highlights parameterization, locators, waits, and robust interaction with dynamic web elements.

**OOP Concepts with Examples**

The GenericConceptsWithExamples folder contains Python scripts demonstrating key OOP principles: 

    Abstraction
    Encapsulation
    Inheritance
    Functions & Methods
    Exception Handling 

**Utilities & Helpers**

Reusable scripts for test data handling, helper functions, and demo files, supporting practical Python and Playwright usage.

**Test Automation Framework Structure**

The project is organized to reflect scalable and maintainable test automation practices:

    pages: Page Object Model implementation
    tests: Pytest test scripts
    testData: Sample JSON data for multiple credentials
    utils: Utility scripts
  
**Key Skills Demonstrated**

    Web automation with Playwright
    Writing maintainable tests using Python and Pytest
    Applying OOP principles effectively
    Handling locators, waits, and interactions on dynamic pages
    Structuring Python projects for clarity and scalability

This repository demonstrates practical coding skills and a strong understanding of Python, OOP, and web automation frameworks. 
It reflects my ability to implement maintainable, real-world automation solutions and contributes to hands-on project readiness.
